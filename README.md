Welcome to all!

These are my Physics projects done over the course of the Spring 2023 semester.

Project 1 is the "The Journey of a BasketBall" file and has to do with finding the motion with/without quadratic drag for a basketball. 

Project 2 is my "Chaotic Motion of a Driven Damped Pendulum" project and has to do with finding that specific chaotic motion with a damping constant since the Pendulum has eventually slow done.
